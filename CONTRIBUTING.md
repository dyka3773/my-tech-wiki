## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/dyka3773/tech-notes/issues) or [Discussions](https://github.com/dyka3773/tech-notes/discussions) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue or discussion and still need clarification, you can write your question in it.

If you can't find an existing issue or discussion, please create a new discussion. We will try to answer your question as soon as possible. Please be patient, as we are all doing this in our free time.

## I Want To Contribute

### Reporting Mistakes

We use GitHub Issues to track all mistakes in the notes. If you find a mistake, please create a new issue. Make sure to include the following information in your issue:
- The path to the file containing the mistake
- The mistake itself
- A suggestion for the correction

If you are not sure about the correction, please prefer to create a new discussion instead of an issue.

Once the issue is created, we will review it and make the necessary changes. If you want to make the changes yourself, please create a pull request. Make sure to include the issue number in the pull request description.

### Adding New Notes

If you want to add new notes, please create a new discussion first. We will discuss the details of the new notes and decide if they are a good fit for this repository. If we decide to include them, you can create a pull request. Make sure to include the discussion number in the pull request description.

### Improving Existing Notes

Same as for reporting mistakes, please create a new issue first. Make sure to include the following information in your issue:
- The path to the file containing the improvements
- The improvements themselves

If you are not sure about the improvements, please prefer to create a new discussion instead of an issue.

## Style Guide

There are no strict rules about the style of the notes yet. However, we would like to keep the notes as simple as possible. This means that we prefer to use Markdown over HTML and we try to avoid using too many images. If you are not sure about the style of your notes, please create a new discussion first.

If you want to add a new note, please make sure to include a `README.md` file in the folder. This file should contain a short description of the technology and a table of contents for the notes. See the [Kafka](Kafka/) folder for an example.

If you want to add a new note to an existing folder, please make sure to include a link to the note in the table of contents. See the [Kafka](Kafka/) folder for an example.

## Commit Messages

We do not use a strict pattern for the commit messages yet. However, we would like to keep the commit messages as simple as possible. This means that we prefer to use the imperative mood and avoid using too many emojis. If you are not sure about the style of your commit messages, please create a new discussion first.

## Join The Project Team

If you would like to join the project team, please create a new discussion. We will discuss the details and decide if you are a good fit for the team. If we decide to include you, you will be added as a collaborator to the repository.
