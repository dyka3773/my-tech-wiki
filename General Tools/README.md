## IDEs and Editors

### [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 

- A lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux.

### [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

- A Java integrated development environment (IDE) for developing computer software.
- It is configurable and extensible through the use of plugins and has a built-in debugging support, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.

- It comes in an ecosystem of IDEs for other languages such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) for Python, [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) for JavaScript, [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) for PHP, [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) for Ruby, [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) for .NET, [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) for Go, and [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) for C/C++. But the community edition of IntelliJ IDEA supports all of these languages.

- It has a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio) which allows you to edit draw.io files directly in VS Code.
  > **Note:** I've found the VS Code extension to be a bit buggy, so I recommend using the online or desktop version instead.
